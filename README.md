A CSS Keyframe Animations Showcase
A creative exploration of modern CSS animations, featuring smooth motion paths, directional control, and complex keyframe transitions.
This project demonstrates how to manipulate HTML elements using pure CSS3 animations without any JavaScript dependencies.

✨ Key Features

 Linear Horizontal Motion: A blue rectangle (box1) that glides smoothly from left to right using linear timing.

 Synchronized Alternation: A second rectangle (box2) that moves in the opposite direction with an ease-in effect.

 Complex Path Animation: A central circle that follows a multi-point coordinate path (0% to 100%) to create a dynamic, "bouncing" visual effect.

 Fluid UI: Uses alternate and alternate-reverse directions to ensure the motion never snaps and feels continuous.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5: Semantic structure for the animation container.

CSS3 Animations: * @keyframes for path definition.

animation-iteration-count: infinite for continuous loops.

position: relative for coordinate-based movement.

🚀 How to View

Download the Code: Save the provided code as an index.html file.

Open in Browser: Double-click the file to open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Watch the Magic: No extra setup is needed—the animations start automatically after a 1-second delay!

📁 Project Logic
Box 1: Moves horizontally across the top.

Box 2: Moves horizontally across the bottom.

Circle: Dances across the screen using a 4-point keyframe system (0%, 30%, 60%, 100%).
